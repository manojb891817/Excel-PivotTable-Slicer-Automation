# Excel-PivotTable-Slicer-Automation
Project Overview
This project showcases a robust Excel dashboard leveraging advanced PivotTable and Slicer automation techniques. Designed for enhanced data analysis, it provides a dynamic and interactive environment for reporting, particularly suitable for sales performance tracking. The solution integrates VBA to synchronize multiple PivotTables with a single set of Slicers, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive user experience.
Key Features
Unified Filtering: Connects and synchronizes multiple PivotTables to a single Slicer control set, enabling consistent data segmentation across various reports (e.g., sales totals, target attainment).
Automated Data Management: Implements VBA scripts for automated data refresh and dynamic adjustment of PivotTable data ranges. This ensures the dashboard remains current with the latest information without manual intervention.
Interactive Dashboard: Features a highly interactive user interface allowing for efficient data exploration. Users can quickly filter and analyze key performance indicators by diverse criteria, such as geographical regions or individual performance metrics.
Sample Data Included: The project is provided with a sample sales dataset to immediately demonstrate its functionalities and analytical capabilities.
Dashboard Components
The dashboard is structured to deliver comprehensive insights into sales operations:
Geographical Slicers: A top-level control panel allows for filtering data by specific cities (e.g., Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Patna).
Sales Executive Performance Metrics:
Total Sales: A detailed breakdown of sales figures per executive.
Target Hit Percentage: Displays the percentage of sales target achieved by each executive.
Deviation From Target Percentage: Illustrates the variance from assigned sales objectives.
Visual Analytics:
Bar Chart: Compares total sales contributions across sales executives.
Pie Chart: Visualizes the distribution of target attainment percentages.
Line Chart: Tracks "Deviation From Target" trends, providing a clear view of performance consistency.
